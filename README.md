# The Perfect Strangers

A general repo for all things related to [The Perfect Strangers](https://www.facebook.com/ThePerfectStrangersRock).

## Stage Diagram

These are diagrams relating to the configuration and placement of people and/or equipment on stage.

### Full Band

This is the general layout of the band. It includes the people, microphones, equipment, cable routes, where power is needed, mixing equipment, and speaker placement.

**Note:**  In a situation where the band is not in charge of the PA, the speakers on the left and right sides of the stage should be omitted from consideration. There will still need to be crowd mics included. If the PS provider already has crows mics set up, they can patch them in to 16 (Right) and 32 (Left) of the bands IEM mix.

### Drum Set

This is the layout of the drum set.

The drummer has everything contained within a marked [DW Large Drum Rug](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/DWCPRUG2--dw-dwcprug2-large-drum-rug). The only spillover will be for the overhead mic stands.

## Input List

This is a list of inputs needed by the band. It includes the input description, type of equipment (such as microphone), if 48v Phantom Power is required, and other notes related to the input channel. Typically, 48V phantom power and gain control are managed on stage by the band's IEM mixing rig.
