## Personnel

### Entourage

Each band member may have an additional person in their entourage (typically a significant other). In addition, the band may also employ up to 2 sound engineers/stagehands. These people should be allowed the same access as the band members and be exempt from being charged any admission or access fee to a venue.

### Personnel for collecting entry fee

If an entry fee/cover charge is required, where the band gets 100% of the cover, the band will provide someone to take up the money. If the cover charge is being split with the venue, then the venue must also provide someone to observe the handling of the money. This helps to ensure everyone is satisfied that the money was handled properly at the end of the night. If the venue fails to provide someone, then they forfeit their rights to dispute anything regarding the handling of entry fee money.

If the venue is 21+ or has house rules to enforce (such as rules related to a liquor license), the venue must provide someone to ID individuals and enforce the house rules. Personnel provided by the band are only responsible for band related activities, such as taking up money at the door.

## Equipment

### Stage area

The band requires a dedicated stage area of at least 20' wide by 20' deep. This should be a dedicated area where through traffic is restricted. This is for the safety of the public, band member, and their equipment.

If a drum riser is to be used, it needs to be at least 10' wide by 10' deep. If the elevation of the rider is greater than 4 feet from the ground, a railing should be installed in the rear of the riser for safety.

### Electrical

The band will provide power conditioners and surge protectors for their equipment. We require the venue to provide enough dedicated breakers for our equipment to operate without issue.

  * PA Speakers
    * 2 x 15 amp breakers
      * One near Downstage Left.
      * One near Downstage Right.
    * If the venue is providing PA sound, then these are not required.
  * IEM box & Amps
    * 2 x 15 amp breakers
      * One new Upstage Right.
      * One new Upstage Left.
    * These are always required.

## Parking

### Band Member Vehicles

The band may need as many as 3 parking spots for members and one extended space for the equipment truck and trailer, totaling 4 spaces.

### Equipment Trailer

For a full band setup, the band uses a covered trailer to transport equipment. The trailer is approximately 9 feet tall (2.75  meters) and 6 feet wide (1.85 meters). This typically exceeds the height of most parking garages. Special parking accommodations close to the loading/unloading area must be made for the trailer if the venue/event utilizes a parking structure where the trailer will not meet the clearance requirements.

The trailer will need to have access close to the area designated for the band to load/unload equipment. This may require the use of parking cones to reserve the space until the band arrives. Please notify the band beforehand if any procedures need to be followed before the band's arrival.

## Refusal to Perform

The band reserves the right to refuse to perform for any reason regarding band member or equipment safety. Such reasons are, but not limited to:
  * Unstable or unsafe building or performance area
  * Volatile or threatening crowd
  * Excessive moisture in the air
  * Threat of severe rain or lightning
  * etc.

We hope never to refuse to perform, but the safety of our band members is our number one priority, followed by the safety of our equipment.
