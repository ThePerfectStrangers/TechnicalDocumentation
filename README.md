**Note:**  In a situation where the band is not in charge of the PA, the PA speakers located Downstage Right and Downstage Left should be omitted from consideration.


# Input List

This is a list of inputs needed by the band. It includes:
  * The input description
  * Type of equipment (such as microphone)
  * If 48V Phantom Power is required
  * Other notes related to the input channel

48V phantom power and gain control are managed on stage by the band's IEM mixing rig. All channels are targetd for a gain of -18.5. A split is used to send a line-level signal to FOH. More information can be found below regarding the split.

### Input + Equipment

</a>

### Split

The band requires a 24-channel split. The band can provide 15 feet of labeled splt tails  (XLR) from the band's IEM box if needed.

Here is a breakdown of the splitter. All ports are XLR male, so a gender changer may be required for certain input ports.
* **1 - 24:** Outputs from the band. This includes vocals and instruments.
* **25 - 29:** Band IEMs. The band brings their own IEMs.
* **30 - 31:** Crows mic inputs.
* **32:** Talk-back input from front-of-house.

**Note:** All outputs are set as `Input/LC` from the band's mixer. You can find out more details regarding the split labels on the Split Map:

## Acoustic

The band can perform in smaller venues with an acoustic set up. This setup replaces the full drum set with a smaller percussion setup, removes the need for IEMs and the IEM box, and shrinks the overall stage footprint.
