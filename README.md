## Stage Diagram

These are diagrams relating to the configuration and placement of people and/or equipment on stage.

### Full Band

This is the general layout of the band. It includes the people, microphones, equipment, cable routes, where power is needed, mixing equipment, and speaker placement.

![Full Band Stage Diagram](./Stage%20Diagram/Full%20Band/Stage%20Diagram.drawio.png)

**Note:**  In a situation where the band is not in charge of the PA, the speakers on the left and right sides of the stage should be omitted from consideration. There will still need to be crowd mics included. If the PS provider already has crows mics set up, they can patch them in to 16 (Right) and 32 (Left) of the bands IEM mix.

## Input List

This is a list of inputs needed by the band. It includes the input description, type of equipment (such as microphone), if 48v Phantom Power is required, and other notes related to the input channel. Typically, 48V phantom power and gain control are managed on stage by the band's IEM mixing rig.

## Parking

### Band Member Vehicles

The band may need as many as 3 parking spots for members and one extended space for the equipment truck adn trailer, totaling 4 spaces.

### Equipment Trailer

For a full band set up, the band uses a covered trailer to transport equipment. The trailer is approximatley 9 feet tall (2.75  meters) and 6 feet wide (1.85 meters). This typically exceeds the height of most parking garages. Special parking accommodations close to the loading/unloading area must be made for the trailer if your venue/event utilizes a parking structure where the trailer will not meet the clearance.

The trailer will need to have access close to the area designated for the band to load/unload equipment. This may require the use of parking cones to reserve the space until the band arrives. Please notify the band beforehand if there are special accommodations made for parking.
